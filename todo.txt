Google material design navigation drawers

TODO:
	Some funkiness with toggle rounding. View by should be broke in a similar fashion (Has to do with removeAllViews being called). Nothing radical but you may want to recreate fragment. Also some funkiness when debugging, regardless, step in the right direction 

	Resupport rest of configure buttons

	Back button is broken, fix it
	Do some cleanup of deprecated classes

	Individual views need better format to support entries for each lift
	(Each individual view willl load three fragments)
	Add timer to each individual view? Perhaps scrollable templates for accessory recording?

	Include warmup in your individualView bs
	Are you sure dialog in second screen if an existing projection already exists, give option to view existing projection.

	UI needs fixed up

	Make shift date prettier

	Figure out a way to get a formatted about page with your giant string  i

	Figure out UI colors


	NEXT RELEASE
	Support bodyweight tracking
    		Options to remove entries
    		Graph with a table
 		Ability to reset with a single (are you sured) button press  		 
	Look into multiple tables for sqlite, refactor if needed to use the damn sql helper like it should instead of yo	your horrible hardcoded table creation in first/second screen
  
	Dashboard icons

	Figure out activity titles

	Track accessory work (Dashboard or drawer entry for managing templates)


	Base lift recording
