What is 5/3/1?

Commonly thrown around in the Strength Training world, 5/3/1 programming
philosophy made popular by Jim Wendler (Buy this book here) - Basically,

your training is centered around "cycles", which consist of performing the big
4 (Bench, squat, deadlift, overhead press) at various frequencies

and percentages based on your training maxes.



Wait, what is a training max?

A training max (in 5/3/1's context) coined by Jim Wendler. It is calculated via
90% of your true max. For example, if my best max ever benching was 300 (and I
haven't 

lost any significant strength since doing it), then my training max would be
300 * .90 = 270. This is the only math you'll need to do. :) At the end of each
cycle,

you training max gets incremented by 10lbs/5kgs for bench/squat and 5lbs/2.5kgs
for ohp/bench. 



Alright... so what is a cycle?

A cycle is determined by your lift pattern (traditionally the 6 day pattern of
Bench, Squat, Rest, Deadlift, Overhead Press, Rest), however, 

if you are more comfortable with another 

pattern, this app supports custom pattern creation. Think of it as your day to
day schedule.

A cycle's length is determined by your lift pattern's size times, so it is
traditionally 18 days. The first third of your cycle will consist of th

'5' part of 5/3/1. You will go through your lift pattern and perform your
working sets for that day at 65% of your training max for a set of 5, 75% for a
set of 5,

and finally 85% for a set of 5. The second third of your cycle with be with
sets of three instead of fives, with percentages 70%, 80%, and 90%.

Finally, the end of your cycle with be your "maxing week", now, unlike the
first two thirds, you will not just be doing singles, rather, you will be
embracing

the entire 5/3/1 name and perform a set of 5 at 75%, a set of 3 at 85%, and a
single at 95%.



What if I fail a lift?!

Then it is time to reset your cycle. You can do this by taking 90% of your
failed training max and resetting your lift projection.
