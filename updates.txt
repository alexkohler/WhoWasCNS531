***RELEASE FEATURES SLOWLY AND MAKE SURE THEY WORK PROPERLY AND HAVE BEEN TESTED THOROUGHLY***

Spreadsheet export 
Ability to save old projections 

User defined accessory templates
Storage considerations?

	Have a table that gets populated with (Be sure you have a proper way to get order because order does matter here.
	|ID|liftType|AcessoryName|

	How are you going to handle deletion of projections?
	I think you should have the ability to save projections and the respective acessories for those lifts  


	Should the accessory table get cleared when you save/delete a projection?

	***I think before this can happen you need to be able to log progress on your compounds, and then figure out how to follow up with accessories from there***

Logging progress on compounds
How can we do this in a way that is cleanly and easy to use?
 

Dashboard
	Do you want an actual dashboard or a drawer menu?
	***I think drawer menu with a “main page” displaying current 1 rep maxes and bodyweight would be best. Also an entry that checks your current projection and tells you what you’re doing that day**** 

	“Manage projection” button on dashboard 
		-Ability to see lifts and respective accessory work for that day 
		
	“Bodyweight tracker” button on dashboard (with a graph because we’re sick kents)

	“View current projection” button
	“create new projection” button 

 
1 rep maxes
	Perhaps keep a 1 rep max/theoretical 1 rep max in a completely separate table, with option to delete it from settings
